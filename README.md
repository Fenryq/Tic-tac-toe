Tic-tac-toe is a game created in Python, based on the tkinter library.
The game is two-player, with 9 fields available. Each player has their own symbol (circle or cross), and the player who occupies 3 positions in a single line first wins.
After completing a game, the program allows for a rematch without restarting the program.
